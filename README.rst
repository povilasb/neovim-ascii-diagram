This is a wannabe remote Neovim plugin that helps to draw ASCII diagrams::

    +--------+  GET    +--------+
    | Client | ------> | Server |
    +--------+         +--------+
      ^                   |

It requires Python > 3.4.

Something like https://github.com/vim-scripts/DrawIt, but implemented in
Python. Thus more extensible and maintainable.
